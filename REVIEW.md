1. Comments. Unnecessary comments (LoginActivity: 30-42). Remove comments.
2. Comments: Unnecessary comments (LoginActivity: 64). Remove comments.
3. Comments: Unnecessary comments (LoginActivity: 126). Remove comments.
4. Layout: Looks like code doesn't belong together, when in reality it does (LoginAcitivity:134-140). Concatenate comments.
5. Layout: Methods used in createOrLogin aren't easily findable (LoginAcitivity: 153). Define methods in order of appearance.
6. Headers: Class header doesn't note what custom classes are going to be used (ChatActivity:30). Note custom classes used as a heads up to reader.

An awesome cross-platform chatapp. There is one chatroom where both iOS and Android users
can rant to their hearts delight. For the iOS version see:
https://github.com/majstomphorst/fireApp-pset06

After login or account creation users are logged in on the device until the app data is cleared. 
Users can then log in with an existing account or create a new one upon launching the app. When
no username is given during account creation, it will default to 'Anonymous'.
